# 🧠 DSA — Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome to the **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** repository!  
This project contains clean and well-documented implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms using **Java**.  
It serves as both a **learning resource** and a **reference** for students, developers, and interview preparation.

## 📚 Contents

### 🔹 Arrays
Basic examples demonstrating how to:
- Create and initialize arrays
- Insert, delete, and update elements
- Traverse and print array contents
- Perform operations such as searching and sorting

**Examples:**
- `Array_Example_01`: Basic array declaration and traversal  
- `Array_Example_02`: Array insertion and deletion  
- `Array_Example_03`: Searching elements in an array  

> 📌 Each example is kept simple and beginner-friendly, focusing on clarity over complexity.

## 🧩 Upcoming Topics

The repository will soon include examples of the following:
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS)
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary)
- Recursion and Dynamic Programming
- Hashing and Maps
