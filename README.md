# 🧠 DSA — Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!

This project contains **clean, well-documented, and fundamental** implementations of core data structures and algorithms using **Java**. It's designed to be a comprehensive resource for **learning, interview preparation, and quick reference** for developers of all levels.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to run these examples.

### How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Lasirena69w/DSA.git](https://github.com/Lasirena69w/DSA.git)
    cd DSA
    ```

2.  **Open in your IDE** (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions) or run directly from your terminal.

3.  **To compile and run a specific example** (e.g., `Array_Example_01.java`):
    ```bash
    # Compile
    javac src/arrays/Array_Example_01.java

    # Run (assuming the compiled class is in the current directory)
    java Array_Example_01
    ```

## 📚 Contents

All examples are organized by topic for easy navigation.

| Topic | Description | Directory |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Arrays** | Basic operations: creation, insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal. | `src/arrays` |
| **Linked Lists** | Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked List implementations. | `src/linkedlists` |
| **Stacks & Queues** | Implementations using arrays and linked lists. | `src/stacks-queues` |
| **Trees** | Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and AVL Trees. | `src/trees` |
| **Graphs** | Traversals (BFS, DFS) and fundamental algorithms. | `src/graphs` |
| **Sorting** | Bubble, Merge, Quick, Insertion, and Selection Sort. | `src/sorting` |
| **Searching** | Linear and Binary Search implementations. | `src/searching` |
| **Recursion** | Classic recursive problems and backtracking. | `src/recursion` |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Basic problems demonstrating memoization and tabulation. | `src/dp` |
| **Hashing** | Hash Tables, Sets, and Maps. | `src/hashing` |

### Current Focus: Arrays

The `src/arrays` directory currently contains:
* `Array_Example_01.java`: Basic declaration and traversal.
* `Array_Example_02.java`: Insertion and deletion operations.
* `Array_Example_03.java`: Searching for elements.

> 💡 **Principle:** Each example prioritizes **clarity** and is designed to be **beginner-friendly**, focusing on the core concept over complex optimizations.
