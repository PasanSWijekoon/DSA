# 🧠 DSA — Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!

This project contains **clean, well-documented, and fundamental** implementations of core data structures and algorithms using **Java**. It's designed to be a comprehensive resource for **learning, interview preparation, and quick reference** for developers of all levels.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to run these examples.

### How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LaSirena-cell/DSA.git
    cd DSA
    ```

2.  **Open in your IDE** (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions) or run directly from your terminal.

3.  **To compile and run a specific example** (e.g., `Array_Example_01.java`):
    ```bash
    # Compile
    javac Array_Example_01/Example01/Array_Example_01.java Array_Example_01/Example01/Array.java

    # Run
    java Example01.Array_Example_01
    ```

## 📚 Contents

All examples are organized by topic for easy navigation.

| Topic | Description | Directory |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Arrays** | Basic operations: creation, insertion, deletion and searching. | `Array_Example_01`, `Array_Example_02`, `Array_Example_03`, `Array_Example_04` |
| **Stacks** | Implementations using arrays and linked lists. | `Stack_Example_01` |

### Current Focus: Arrays and Stacks

The `Array` examples contain:
* `Array_Example_01`: Basic array creation and adding elements.
* `Array_Example_02`: Inserting elements at a specific index.
* `Array_Example_03`: Searching for elements.
* `Array_Example_04`: Deleting elements.

The `Stack` examples contain:
* `Stack_Example_01`: Implementation of Stack using both array and linked list.

> 💡 **Principle:** Each example prioritizes **clarity** and is designed to be **beginner-friendly**, focusing on the core concept over complex optimizations.
